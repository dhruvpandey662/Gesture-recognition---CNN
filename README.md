# Gesture-recognition---CNN
## Problem Statement
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Gesture	Corresponding Action
Thumbs Up	Increase the volume.
Thumbs Down	Decrease the volume.
Left Swipe	'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
Right Swipe	'Jump' forward 10 seconds.
Stop	Pause the movie.
Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).
